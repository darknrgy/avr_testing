Clear Timer on
Compare Match (CTC)
Mode
In Clear Timer on Compare or CTC mode (WGM13:0 = 4 or 12), the OCR1A or ICR1 Register
are used to manipulate the counter resolution. In CTC mode the counter is cleared to zero when
the counter value (TCNT1) matches either the OCR1A (WGM13:0 = 4) or the ICR1 (WGM13:0 =
12). The OCR1A or ICR1 define the top value for the counter, hence also its resolution. This
mode allows greater control of the Compare Match output frequency. It also simplifies the operation
of counting external events.
The timing diagram for the CTC mode is shown in Figure 37. The counter value (TCNT1)
increases until a Compare Match occurs with either OCR1A or ICR1, and then counter (TCNT1)
is cleared.


An interrupt can be generated at each time the counter value reaches the TOP value by either
using the OCF1A or ICF1 Flag according to the register used to define the TOP value. If the
interrupt is enabled, the interrupt handler routine can be used for updating the TOP value.
