-Timer/Counter Control
-Register – TCCR2

TCCR2

- bit 6 and 3 determine mode
- use fast pwm mode
- WGM21 = 1
- WGM20 = 1
setbit (TCCR2, BIT(WGM20) | BIT(WGM21));

- skip bits 4 and 5, they determine automatic pin behavior 

- bits 2, 1, 0 determine clock scalar. we want 8.
- CS22 CS21 CS20 are all the bits used
- we want 010
- which means
setbit( BIT(CS21));


- TCNT2 is the counter value

- OCR2 is the output compare value

- Output Compare
- Register – OCR2



- Asynchronous Status Register
- ASSR
- Bit 3, AS2
- When AS2 is written to zero, Timer/Counter 2 is clocked from the I/O clock
- which is what we want

- Timer/Counter Interrupt Mask Register 
- TIMSK
